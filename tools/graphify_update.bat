REM graphify_update.bat  --  TEMPLATE
REM
REM Manual, no-AI live-graph refresh + smoke test. Copy this into your
REM project's  tools\  folder and adjust CODE_DIR below to your source folder
REM (lib / src / app / internal ...). Run it after code changes or to check
REM graphify works.
REM
REM What it does (no LLM, no API key, no token cost):
REM   [1/2] Code-only AST refresh of the LIVE root graphify-out\graph.json via
REM         `graphify update`. GRAPHIFY_OUT is pointed at the root folder and
REM         CODE_DIR is passed absolute -- both required, otherwise the CLI
REM         writes a stray graph under CODE_DIR\graphify-out\ or re-anchors
REM         every node id. Directed flag + community labels are kept.
REM         Docs are not re-extracted; a FIRST build is the skill flow
REM              /graphify CODE_DIR --directed
REM         inside Claude -- never delete graph.json before running this bat.
REM   [2/2] Smoke test -- confirm the live root graph exists, is directed, and
REM         answers a query. This is the "does graphify actually work here" check.
